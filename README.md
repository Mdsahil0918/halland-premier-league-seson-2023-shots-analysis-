# README: Erling Haaland 2023-2024 Shot Analysis

Welcome to the Erling Haaland Shot Analysis project for the 2023-2024 Premier League season! This project visualizes Haalandâ€™s shots and their quality throughout the season. The analysis is presented using Matplotlib for visualization, including scatter plots and annotations, to provide insights into Haaland's performance.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on visualizing the shot data of Erling Haaland during the 2023-2024 Premier League season. The visualizations include:

- **Shot Quality Analysis**: Displays shots categorized by quality, with an emphasis on "Low Quality Chance" and "High Quality Chance."
- **Shot Distribution**: Shows the distribution of shots on the pitch with different sizes representing xG (expected goals).
- **Performance Metrics**: Highlights key statistics such as total shots, goals, xG (expected goals), and xG per shot.

## Prerequisites

To run the analysis and visualizations, you will need:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **Required Python Libraries**:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `some_pitch_library` (replace with the actual library you use for drawing the pitch)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/haaland-shot-analysis.git
   cd haaland-shot-analysis
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**

   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

   ```
   matplotlib
   pandas
   numpy
   some_pitch_library
   ```

   Install the libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Data**

   Ensure that your data file (e.g., `shots_data.csv`) is in the correct format with columns like `X`, `Y`, `xG`, and `result` indicating shot coordinates, expected goals, and whether the shot resulted in a goal or not.

2. **Run the Analysis Script**

   Execute the script to generate the visualizations:

   ```bash
   python analysis_script.py
   ```

   This script will produce a figure containing:
   - A header with the analysis title and labels.
   - A pitch plot showing shot distribution and quality.
   - A statistics section with key performance metrics.

3. **View the Output**

   The output will be saved as an image file (e.g., `haaland_shot_analysis.png`) in the same directory. Open this file to view the visualizations.

## Project Structure

- **`analysis_script.py`**: Main script for generating the visualizations.
- **`data/`**: Directory containing the data file (`shots_data.csv`) and any other necessary files.
- **`results/`**: Directory where the output images are saved.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python libraries.
- **`README.md`**: This file.
